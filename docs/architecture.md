# kor-AssetForge Architecture

## Overview

kor-AssetForge is a decentralized platform for tokenizing and trading real-world assets on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts.

## System Components

### 1. Smart Contracts (Soroban/Rust)

**AssetToken Contract**

- Manages tokenized asset creation and lifecycle
- Handles minting, burning, and transfers
- Stores asset metadata on-chain
- Implements fractional ownership

**Marketplace Contract**

- Manages asset listings
- Handles buy/sell orders
- Executes atomic swaps
- Maintains order book

### 2. Backend API (Go)

**Responsibilities**

- RESTful API for frontend integration
- Off-chain data storage (PostgreSQL)
- Stellar blockchain interaction
- User authentication and authorization
- Event indexing from blockchain

**Key Modules**

- `handlers/`: HTTP request handlers
- `models/`: Database models (GORM)
- `utils/`: Stellar SDK integration
- `config/`: Configuration management

### 3. Database (PostgreSQL)

**Schema**

- `assets`: Asset metadata and references
- `listings`: Marketplace listings
- `transactions`: Transaction history
- `users`: User profiles and KYC status
- `user_balances`: Token balance tracking

## Data Flow

### Asset Tokenization Flow

1. User submits asset details via API
2. Backend validates and stores metadata
3. Smart contract deployed on Stellar
4. Tokens minted to owner's address
5. Asset registered in database with contract ID

### Trading Flow

1. Seller creates listing via API
2. Backend calls marketplace contract
3. Listing stored on-chain and in database
4. Buyer submits purchase request
5. Smart contract executes atomic swap
6. Database updated with transaction

## Security Considerations

- Private keys never stored in backend
- User authentication via Stellar signatures
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- KYC/AML compliance for regulated assets
- Smart contract audits before mainnet

## Scalability

- Horizontal scaling of API servers (stateless, any instance serves any request)
- Database read replicas for queries
- Caching layer (Redis) for frequent reads
- Event-driven architecture for async processing
- Stellar's high throughput (1000+ TPS)

See [SCALING_GUIDE.md](./SCALING_GUIDE.md) for horizontal scaling, connection
pool sizing, and capacity planning; [LOAD_BALANCER_CONFIG.md](./LOAD_BALANCER_CONFIG.md)
for load balancer setup; [DATABASE_REPLICATION.md](./DATABASE_REPLICATION.md) for
read replicas; and [ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md](./ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md) for the
scaled deployment topology. Kubernetes manifests are in
[`kubernetes/deployment.yaml`](../kubernetes/deployment.yaml).

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-signature support for high-value assets
- Automated compliance checks
- Oracle integration for price feeds
- Cross-chain bridges
- Mobile SDK
- Governance token for platform decisions
